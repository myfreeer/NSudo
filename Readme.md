Context Menu:
  -Install   Copy NSudo to the Windows directory and add the context menu.
  -Uninstall Remove NSudo in the Windows directory and the context menu. 

PS:
    1. All NSudo command arguments is case-insensitive.
    2. You can use the "/" override "-" in the command line parameters. For 
       example, "/U:T" and "-U:T" are equivalent.
    3. To ensure the best experience, NSudoC does not support context menu.

Example:
    If you want to run Command Prompt with TrustedInstaller, enable all 
    privileges and the default Integrity Level.
        NSudo -U:T -P:E cmd
```
Example：If you want to run Command Prompt with TrustedInstaller, enable all 
privileges and the default Integrity Level
> NSudo -U:T -P:E cmd

You can edit NSudo.json to custom the Shortcut list, here are the demo 
(NSudo.json in the NSudo.exe's folder):
```
{
  "ShortCutList_V2": {

    "Command Prompt": "cmd",
    "PowerShell": "powershell",
    "PowerShell ISE": "powershell_ise",
    "Edit Hosts": "notepad %windir%\\System32\\Drivers\\etc\\hosts"
  }
}
```
Starting from NSudo 5.0.1708.16, the command line nested quotes is supported. 
For example: 
> NSudo -U:T cmd /c "dir "C:\Program Files" & pause"

## The way to compile NSudo
- If you need to compile NSudo, you need to install Visual Studio 2017 first.
- You need to change the Windows SDK version in the project properties if the 
  version of Windows 10 SDK I used isn't installed on your PC. You also need 
  install ARM and ARM64 components when you installing the Windows 10 Version 
  1703 SDK or later.
- (Optional) If you want to reduce the release mode binaries size for x86, x64
  and ARM64 port of NSudo, you can use VC-LTL.
  - VC-LTL GitHub Repository: https://github.com/Chuyu-Team/VC-LTL
  - How to use VC-LTL to optimize NSudo binaries size:
    - Download VC-LTL binary pack from 
	  https://github.com/Chuyu-Team/VC-LTL/releases/latest.
    - Unpack the VC-LTL binary pack and double-click install.cmd in the unpack
	  folder.
    - Compile NSudo by Visual Studio 2017.
